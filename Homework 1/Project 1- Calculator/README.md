This project takes input from a user and helps guide them on how to use the tool. 
You can add, subtract, multiply divide and find out which word comes first in the dictionary using two strings. 

This was a simply but tedious project, I implemented a switch case option where you would add the same logic in the switch case as in the if else tree. Something that makes sense to do is declare the variables outside of the conditionals, and assign them in the conditionals, this just helps clean up the code. The benefit to keeping them local is they aren't created in memory unless you perform that operation, saving some resources.  

For the future:

I will update later with a while loop -> while continue =yes || y run the calculator, otherwise break
